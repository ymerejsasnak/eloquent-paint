# eloquent-paint
Eloquent JS - paint program




ideas:
add transparency selection to color (see globalAlpha? or set stroke/fillstyle w/ rgba?)

create weird/unusual tools, particle based things, things with physics, fibonacci, etc etc etc 
'wacky shapes' - draw rectangle with randomized bezier curves?

change save to save a file or local storage or something.

add flood fill (see exercise) and maybe color picker? (also exercise)
